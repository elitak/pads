1. Add column to base types table to indicate which PADS/X type to use
   for a given base type. Right now, the rep type is used.

2. Change BaseTy module to handle new column

3. Add function(s) for accessing the info.

4. For each PADS construct that generates PADS/X code, change base
   type name to correct one.
   x Ptypedef
   - Pstruct
   - Punion
   - Parray
   - Penum

5. Add correct functions to pglx library.
   - pglx-internal.h: add necessary declarations (2).
   - pglx.c: 
     <new_type>_typed_value
     <new_type>_sndNode_typed_value
     PDCI_IMPL_BASE_VT(<new_type>);
     PDCI_IMPL_BASE_VAL_VT(<new_type>); or  PDCI_IMPL_BASE_VAL_VT_ARG1 ...
   - path_walk.h: add necessary decls.
     + make sure to surround with #ifndef FOR_CKIT, as needed.
   - path_walk.c:PDCI_DEF_BASE_PATH_WALK(<new_type>);


notes:

Should the children of Ppos (byte,num) really be Pint32? Their reps are size_t,
which is an unsigned long. See, for example, path_walk.c.
