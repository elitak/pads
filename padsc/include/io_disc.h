/* THE IO DISCIPLINE
 *
 * Type Pio_disc_t is used to control the 'raw' reading of data
 * from a file or from some other data source.  
 *
 * Implementations of the standard IO disciplines can be found in
 * libpads/default_io_disc.c.  Anyone planning to implement a new IO
 * discipline should consult default_io_disc.c.
 *
 * From a user standpoint, what is needed is knowledge about how to
 * install different disciplines.  The standard disciplines are
 * installed by making an instance of an IO discipline using one
 * of the following make functions, and then either passing 
 * the resulting handle either to P_open or to P_set_io_disc.
 *
 * Note that there are two versions of each kind of IO discipline:
 *    fwrec and fwrec_noseek
 *    ctrec and ctrec_noseek
 *    vlrec and vlrec_noseek
 *    norec and norec_noseek
 * The noseek versions do not require that the sfio stream
 * be seekable, while the other versions do.  
 *
 * In addition, the user should 'unmake' an IO discipline once it
 * is no longer needed.  This can be achieved by using 
 * PDC_close, or by installing a new IO discipline using P_set_io_disc.
 * However, if an IO discipline is 'kept' around using, e.g., 
 * P_close_keep_io_disc, or P_set_io_disc_keep_old, then 
 * it can be re-used in a future P_open or P_set_io_disc call,
 * and the user may have to unmake it explicitly when it is no longer
 * needed, using:
 *
 *    P_io_disc_unmake(my_io_disc)
 *

 * while leader_len and trailer_len specifies the number of bytes that
 * occur before and after the data bytes within each record (either or
 * both can be zero).  Thus the total record size in bytes is the sum
 * of the 3 arguments.

 * hint as to what block size to use, if the discipline chooses to do
 * fixed block-sized reads 'under the covers'.  It may be ignored by
 * the discipline.
 * 
 * For ASCII newline-terminated records use, '\n' or P_ASCII_NEWLINE
 * as the term character.  For EBCDIC newline-terminated records, use
 * P_EBCDIC_NEWLINE as the term character.

 * grouped into blocks, where each block has a length given at the
 * start of each block.  avg_rlen_hint is a hint as to what the
 * average record length is, to help the discipline allocate memory.
