When you take a new set of tgz files from gsf you should take the
latest version of the bin/package script (which gets installed when it
unbundles and builds ast) and copy it to 'bin/package.cvs'

The goal of bin/package.cvs was to avoid having the copyright notice
cause a change to the CVS repository every time ast is rebuilt.   But
we do want package.cvs to get updated one time -- when there is a new
INIT.tgz file.
